# FAQ

<details>

<summary> If I change my SNS account name or icon, will it automatically update on Yabumi ? </summary>

No. You will need to manually update it. After connecting your wallet and signing in to your SNS account, please press the "Profile Update" button below the icon to update it.

<summary>It is mentioned that if I burn Yabumi NFT, it can be reminted from same address. Is it possible to remint if I transfer Yabumi NFT instead of burning it? </summary>

No, it is not possible. The system allows for minting only one Yabumi NFT per account. Therefore, if your account gets hacked or the NFT gets stolen, you need to burn it with the original issuing address and remint it from a secure wallet.
