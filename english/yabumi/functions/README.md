Yabumi allows minting of Yabumi NFTs, which link SNS accounts to wallet addresses.&#x20;

These NFTs keep track of SNS account names and icon, enabling senders to choose from Yabumi NFT list to send tokens. (disbursement to multiple recieivers is also feasible).

Yabumi NFTs can be transferred to a new wallet address, which then serves as the new recipient, if the recipient decides to change their wallet address.&#x20;

Through Yabumi platform, both parties can avoid communicating wallet address, making the transfers of tokens and NFTs simple and smooth.
