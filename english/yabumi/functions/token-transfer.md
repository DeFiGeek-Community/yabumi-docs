# Token Transfer

The sender selects the recipient from the Yabumi NFT list and specifies the token type and number when making a transfer.&#x20;

By specifying multiple NFTs, it is also easy to send tokens in one shot (batch sending).&#x20;

As long as the recipient has the Yabumi NFT, the sender can send tokens to their wallet without knowing the recipient's wallet address.&#x20;

In addition, the recipient can receive incentives or other transactions while keeping their wallet address totally undisclosed by using zero-knowledge proofs (zkp), assuring privacy. (At present, it is still being developed; please see the roadmap.)

Yabumi NFTs can be transferred to a new wallet address, which then serves as the new recipient.
