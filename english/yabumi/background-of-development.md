# Background of development

DeFiGeek Community is a decentralized community that has been developing DeFi Dapps and tools.&#x20;

Several contributors in Discord receive rewards every month. The DAO administrators must keep record of the wallet addresses for each Discord account because the rewards vary for each one.



What we did before:

1. Each contributor sends DM to admin to inform wallet address. (first time or when they want to change wallet)
2. Admin manually link Discord account to the wallet address.
3. Admin create token transfer transaction to distribute rewards.



Issues:

There is a disconnect between SNS accounts (Discord) and wallets, requiring effort and cost for linking, maintenance, and manually create token transfer transaction.



Solution:

Yabumi was born as a solution to these challenges to automate entire process.
